# Basketball-Analytics
Repository for my data and code for my basketball-related analysis projects.
I'll be posting the data I use and my code so that others can take a look and play around with it. If you see a mistake, let me know! And if you want to work on something, I'm happy to do that, too. 
Feedback would be awesome!
